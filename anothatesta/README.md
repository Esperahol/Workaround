Hi Jo!
Sorry I haven't been as punctual or as helpful as I would like.

Here is what is in this package:

> Admin has a trio of components that set it up similar to what Brewer has.

> Beer Lover didn't get done this time around - the rating and review components were previously uploaded to the workaround so that is there for usage.

> Brewer components are everything outside of the Admin and Beer Lover folders.

>Add Beer is a form to upload a new beer
Beer is the object
BeerList makes up an entire page and lets the Brewer add, update, and delete a beer.

>RatingDisplay is needed for the View function - using the GET API it should generate a viewing of the ratings.

>Retrieve and SimpleUserTable go together and were the inital building blocks for the View page.

Update is a page that allows the Brewery to update it's self or at least it should.

>Services is a folder containing a simple component that allows for the create and standardization of the endpoints needed for actions like put, get, and the like. 

http-common.js is a file that holds the common url/api part of things. Interestingly enough .env is needed for that as well.

I'm sorry if anything is broken or doesn't work as intended and hope I haven't made more work for you. Have a great day!

P.S. - cute little rating star thingy in Beer Lover.
